Spark Owls
Description
- The Spark Owls are an extant member of the Songbird family, the only fire-based songbirds still alive today. Spark Owls possess a vast wingspan, approximately seven times the length of their body, <link: Sound-storage#sparkowl<feathered with plumage capable of absorbing and reemiting sounds>>. This gives Fire Owls the unique ability to fly completely silently, allowing them to swoop down on prey without alerting them.
- Once a Spark Owl reaches their prey, however, they are nothing but quiet. In a split-second, the owl releases a deafening, concentrated soundwave powered by their feathers and greatly enhanced by a simultaneous gust of fire (This gust of fire is short-lived, but extremely bright, lending the name Spark Owl to these birds.) Most creatures are incapable of handling shockwaves of the Owl's soundwave's magnitude, and will immediately be concussed or enter a coma. The only species capable of physically withstanding an attack of the Owl unscathed are those of the <<Stalwart>> clan.
- Another unique ability of the Spark Owl is their ability to metabolize <<Darkness energy>> into Fire energy. As such, their prey are typically members of the <<Darkness clan>>. To help aid them catch the speedy, hidden creatures of the Darkness clan, Spark Owls possess an unrivaled capability to sense collections of Darkness magic.
Human Impact
- Spark Owls are a frequent interruptor of <<Darkness>> <<Ward forgers>>, as the bubble of night around <link: Wards<Warding machines>> commonly attract Spark Owls searching for food. In biomes with large collections of Spark Owls (eg. <<darkforest>>) Darkness Wards are quickly destroyed by the confused birds.

Employment (magic)
- ("Employment" is a song-magic process. For "employment" as in working a job, visit <link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment<here>>.)
- Employment is a process of <<song-magic>>, wherein Divine or Profane songs are used to either coax or force magic-particles suspended in air to perform *duties*. Duties come in a variety of categories, from <link:wards<warding barriers>> to offensive attacks, or to more industrial processes like transporting goods or producing raw material.
Divine Songs
- The behavior of magic-particles varies greatly depending on the type of song. Divine songs are melodies that call upon an <<Elemental God>>'s <<intent>> to gently coax particles to do certain tasks.
Sapience Exclusivity Theory
- Divine Songs are the only known song-based method to produce living creatures. However, creatures produced by the hand of a Elemental God are incapable of sapience.
- It has been theorized and widely accepted then that this incapability is due to an <link:akamaku#inherent_laws<inherent law in the universe>>. This law has been dubbed Divine Exclusivity from Sapience, or simply Sapience Exclusivity.
- Under this reasoning, however, it should have been impossible for Man to have achieved sapience. The problem of the <<Origin of Man>> has thus become an intensly debated area by <<song-sages>> and scientists alike since the inception of the sapience-exclusivity theory.
So who made man, do you think?

Ojemenou (Poem)
"Ojemenou" is the title of a poem written during the Common

Wards
- These barries come in different categories; some barriers protect only against song-attacks, others defend from physical hits, and some are even so specialized as to protect against everything but their owner.
- Wards are the first song-spells.
- The order in which elemental ward spells were discovered is known as the Grand Order of Intuity.
- This is because the order denotes the complexity of the magical-particles that form that element.
- It is theorized that the order is endless, but humans have only discovered 11 of the elements of the set. To discover more, more and more esoteric geometries of magical-particles are required. Some think that higher-dimensions are required to go beyond 11.
Wardstones
- Wardstones are machines that employ surrounding elemental magic to produce <<wards>>.

Magical Particles (Mifunsou'sae)
- Magical Energy particle structures that resonate with certain elements.
- eg. Fire
List of Magical Particles

Memetic Hazards
- sometimes knowledge gatherers can receive a memetic hazard that threatens to overwrite the whole thing
- it's an idea that unravels as it's thought about


Knowfeather
- a measure of information, typically defined as one one hundredth of a perfectly filled knowledge crystal.
- as knowledge crystals are usually not perfectly filled, in practical usage, a knowfeather is simply 1% of a filled low-grade knowledge crystal.

Great War Era
- a 50,000 year long era where the precursors (and the wovenstrong system) suppressed large societies from forming
